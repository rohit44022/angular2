NgStyle attribute is used to style multiple inline styles in Ang2

Event Binding:
-------------- Event binding flows data  in the opposite  direction from html  element to a component 
               2.when we use event binding we have to use brackets like ()--> this means in ang2 that we want to bind an event


Structual directive

two way data binding: For two way data binding if we want to show or pass textbox data to paragraph we have to use property binding () and also (input) event
binding along withn $event.target.value. There is another easy method to same kind of operation by using ngModel porperty provided by angular 2. for model binding we use banana in box like [(ngmodel)] annotation.

When we are using [(ngModel)] initailly it gives us error if we do not setup our environment correctly.You can check error in console tab.
Error state that ngModel is not import in our application for for fix please see below instruction.
1.go to app.module.ts file and make entry of ngModel sameas  ngModule  and browserModule.
2.ngmodule is in different module so you have to make entru in a way --> import{FormsModule} from ''@angular/forms';'
3.ngModel comes from '@angular/forms'; module
4 also make same module entry in @ngModule section same like --> imports: [BrowserModule, ngModule ], 

Angular ngFor Directive:
---------------------------
*ngFor is structual directive 
What is structual directive?
Ans:.Structural directives are responsible for HTML layout. They shape or reshape the DOM's structure, typically by adding, removing, or manipulating elements.

Angular trackby
----------------



Angular Pipe:
------------
angular custom pipe use to create a custom filter and for this create a new typescript file name as xxxxx.pipe.ts

2. Angular pipe also uses interface which is PipeTransform.so wen we create a new pipe ts file always impliment interface 
example export class custompipe impliemts PipeTransform

3. Also import pipe as declaration
example : import{pipe} from'@angular/core';

4: PipeTransform interface is having one method which is called transform(value,arguments) 

also import pipetransform interface along with pipe

Angular Container and Nestd Componenet:
--------------------------------------
1.nested component is a component which is nest under its parent component.
2.we can pass parent component data to its nested component for that we have to import input property and bind all properties with @input() directive

Passing user action or event from child component to parent component
                            or
user entered value from child component to parent component
------------------------------------------------------------------------ 
1.to pass data from child compponent to parent componenet we have to create a custom event and use of output properties
so for this import {output,EventEmitter} class to child componenet
2: event Emmiter class is used to create a custom event
3: if we want to crate a event we have to decorate that event with @Output() property

CustomEvents:
----------------
custom events is to provide and share information between different components in your application without having to directly linking them
ngModel is a directive that allows your input to participate in a form


Angular Life Cycle Hooks
*****************************
create the component
renders the componenet
create and render  the componenet  children
checks when  the component  data bound  properties  changes 
destory the component before  removing it from from dom

ngOnchange :  executes every time when value of input property changes

mngOninit: execute after  the constructor  and after ngOnchange  hooks for the first time 

ngOndistory : executes  just before  angular destory  the componenet  and generally  used for  performing cleanup












************************************
Important Notes:
1- Component .ts class file name is same as what we define in module class where we export class to make entry in module class


Services in Angular:
*******************

To use services in ang02 we need to export injectable package and after that making ts file as a service use @injectable

Angular 2 and web api
*********************
1.With in  root module(app Module), import  the angular  HTTPmodule


Angular 2 Error handling
************************
In error handling we have to use first catch oprator in our custom service.
2.one catch is register in import statement then use .catch method , with inisde 
3.then in component file where we want to show error we have to use , (error)=>{}


Angular Routing
***************
1. select and set base href uel to  /src/ in index.html file
2. import router module and define routes.
/now we create a route for our application bu now we need to tell angular that use these route and for this we have to register entry in ngmodule, routermodule
4.tie the routes in html application 
5.RouterLinkActive is used to set menu item active on load after when we click on another tab it will showthat tab as active
6.router-outlet directive is used to tell angular that when we click on link it will load or render that component html.

To read the browser url we can use activatedRoute service
